Welcome to my blog.

This is where I'll be sharing thoughts on technology, software engineering, and whatever else catches my interest.

## Why write?

Writing helps me think. It forces clarity. When you have to explain something to others, you first have to understand it yourself.

## What to expect

I'll be writing about:

- Technical deep-dives into problems I've solved
- Tools and workflows that make me more productive
- Ideas and observations about the tech industry
- Occasional personal updates

No schedule, no pressure. Just writing when I have something worth saying.

Thanks for reading. More to come.
